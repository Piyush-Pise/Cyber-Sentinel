# Cyber-Sentinel
Game Development project for Glitchpop Game Jam

Motivation : The game is motivated by the theme of ‘Glitch’, Set inside the motherboard of a computer, the PC is under attack by a malware infestation. Sensitive unbacked documents are at stake, the PC has deployed its SPD(Software Protection Department) units to fight against this attack. You are one of these front-line units.

Moving across the motherboard, clean it’s components of the infestation and eliminate the threat.

Gameplay : It is a platform based, third person shooter. There are three levels, each level involving cleaning a specific component attached to the motherboard, i.e, GPU, CPU, RAM. 

The SPD units use QVEs(QuickKill Virus Eliminators) to shoot down the viruses. 

You have to keep track of your unit’s health bar and your QVE’s ammo count to make sure you don’t run out of any of the two. 

The viruses appear as bouncing enemies who reduce health points upon coming in contact with the SPD unit. Keep distance from them.`


Graphics :  To help capture the theme of ‘Glitch’, the game's graphics are designed to create a cyberpunk-themed environment with neon lights. The game's sound design also aims to achieve a cyberpunk like feel with the electronic sound effects.

The platform obstacles are modelled with capacitors, transistors, IC chips and other components you find on a motherboard, to make the environment simulate the feel of the battles taking place inside computer hardware.
