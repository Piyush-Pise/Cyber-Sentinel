# Cyber-Sentinel
Game Development project for Glitchpop Game Jam

### Motivation
The game is motivated by the theme of ‘Glitch’, Set inside the motherboard of a
computer, the PC is under attack by a malware infestation. Sensitive unbacked documents
are at stake, the PC has deployed its SPD(Software Protection Department) units to fight
against this attack. You are one of these front-line units.
Moving across the motherboard, clean it’s components of the infestation and eliminate the
threat.

### Gameplay
It is a platform based, third person shooter. There are three levels, each level
involving cleaning a specific component attached to the motherboard, i.e, GPU, CPU, RAM.
The SPD units use QVEs(QuickKill Virus Eliminators) to shoot down the viruses.
You have to keep track of your unit’s health bar and your QVE’s ammo count to make sure
you don’t run out of any of the two.
The viruses appear as bouncing enemies who reduce health points upon coming in contact
with the SPD unit. Keep distance from them.

### Controls
(1) ‘W’, ‘A’, ‘S’, ‘D’ for Forward, Left, Right, Backward
(2) ‘Space’ for jump
(3) ‘R’ for Reload
(4) ‘Right Click’ for Firing

### Graphics
To help capture the theme of ‘Glitch’, the game's graphics are designed to
create a cyberpunk-themed environment with neon lights. The game's sound design also
aims to achieve a cyberpunk like feel with the electronic sound effects.
The platform obstacles are modelled with capacitors, transistors, IC chips and other
components you find on a motherboard, to make the environment simulate the feel of the
battles taking place inside computer hardware.

### Sources
Assets have been taken from Unity Assests Store, CGTrader, TurboSquid

Tips: When shooting an enemy, point the laser such that it intersects the enemy.
